       "      <td>Ecological restoration programs have significantly contributed to the improvement of ecosystem services in the past two decades. However, due to climate change and rapid land use change, planning and management of ecosystem services restoration programs are still challenging, particularly how to identify and quantify the specific contribution of natural and human drivers of ecosystem services dynamics, how to assess and simulate the integrated impacts of climate-land use change interactions on changes in ecosystem services, insufficient simulation of mid- and long-term impacts of different ecological restoration programs, and lack of identification of ecological restoration thresholds. To overcome the challenges, we propose a new framework for restoring ecosystem services programs as potential solutions to the challenges. The framework includes attribution analysis of changes in ecosystem services, assessment and projections of ecosystem services dynamics under the integrated impacts of climate-land use change interactions, simulation of mid- and long-term effects of ecological programs and identification of ecological restoration threshold, which forms the logic chain of the framework, i.e. theory foundation-techniques support-application cases-policy implications. We finally recommend four related research directions and steps forward to overcome the challenges, including (1) Step 1: establish attribution analysis method of ecosystem services dynamics based on ecological thermodynamics and partial differential equation; (2) Step 2: Assess and simulate the impacts of coupled climate-land use change interactions on ecosystem services dynamics; (3) Step 3: Simulate the mid- and long-term impacts of different ecological restoration programs; and (4) Step 4: Identify ecological restoration thresholds. This study could provide insights for improving management of ecosystem services restoration programs in the context of rapid land use change and continuous climate change.</td>\n",

However, due to climate change and rapid land use change, planning and management of ecosystem services restoration programs are still challenging, particularly how to identify and quantify the specific contribution of natural and human drivers of ecosystem services dynamics, how to assess and simulate the integrated impacts of climate-land use change interactions on changes in ecosystem services, insufficient simulation of mid- and long-term impacts of different ecological restoration programs, and lack of identification of ecological restoration thresholds. To overcome the challenges, we propose a new framework for restoring ecosystem services programs as potential solutions to the challenges. The framework includes attribution analysis of changes in ecosystem services, assessment and projections of ecosystem services dynamics under the integrated impacts of climate-land use change interactions, simulation of mid- and long-term effects of ecological programs and identification of ecological restoration threshold, which forms the logic chain of the framework, i.e. theory foundation-techniques support-application cases-policy implications. We finally recommend four related research directions and steps forward to overcome the challenges, including (1) Step 1: establish attribution analysis method of ecosystem services dynamics based on ecological thermodynamics and partial differential equation; (2) Step 2: Assess and simulate the impacts of coupled climate-land use change interactions on ecosystem services dynamics; (3) Step 3: Simulate the mid- and long-term impacts of different ecological restoration programs; and (4) Step 4: Identify ecological restoration thresholds. This study could provide insights for improving management of ecosystem services restoration programs in the context of rapid land use change and continuous climate change.

Offset ratios are commonly used to determine the extent of habitat areas that need to be restored elsewhere to achieve no net loss in wetlands; however, most calculation methods focus on individual impacts.
